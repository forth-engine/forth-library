Forth Engine's Core C++ Library

Forth-Library is a Library to manipulate four dimensional objects via Cross Sectional Projection. My biggest motivation to create this library is to have my asset [Engine4](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/engine-4-34475) moving away from Unity. Creating one more degree of freedom to create higher-dimensional gaming to interested parties.

Forth-Library is part of higher project *Forth Engine*. Forth Engine is not just about displaying higher dimensional objects: There will be Physics, Scene Management, Import/Export, Graphics Patches, The Editor, etc.. It's future aim is to became a full blown Independent Game Engine.

Playable demos is at [Forth-Engine/demo](https://github.com/forth-engine/demo)
